# 🚨 Alerts History Dashboard – Power BI Project

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Alerts History Dashboard** is a Power BI report that visualizes missile and terrorist infiltration alerts in Israel during **October 2023**.  
Using a **custom Python scraper**, I extracted real-time data from the official [Home Front Command Alerts History](https://www.oref.org.il/heb/alerts-history) website and structured it into an Excel file.

This dashboard provides detailed insights into:
- Alert frequency by location and time  
- Types of alerts  
- Peak hours and days  
- Geographical distribution of incidents  

It is especially useful for security analysts, researchers, and emergency preparedness planning.
